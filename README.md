HELLO MY I GO BY ELY RODRIGUEZ. I AM A CERTIFIED SURGICAL TECHNOLOGIST. I RECENTLY DECIDED TO SWITCH MY CAREER TO ENINEERING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE REASON WHY I AM TAKING THIS CLASS IS TO HOPEFULLY SEE IF I TRULY ENJOY THE LEARNING PROCESS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. I HOPE THAT THIS CLASS CHALLENGES ME AND MAKES ME LEARN NEW MATERIAL. I AM EXCITED TO LEARN NEW TOPICS.
